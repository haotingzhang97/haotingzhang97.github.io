title: About me
---

I am Haoting Zhang, a first year PhD student under the HDR UK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science, currently based at University of Cambridge. Previously, I attended the University of Oxford for my undergraduate study in Mathematics and Statistics, before studying for a Masterâ€™s degree in Machine Learning at UCL. 

Through my education, I have developed interest in applying Machine Learning to healthcare. In particular, I am interested in Deep Generative and Probabilistic Models. I believe they have the potential to be utilised in healthcare because they provide routes to inserting prior knowledge, interpreting results and estimating uncertainty compared to their deterministic counterparts. However, many gaps remain to be filled, and I am generally interested in tackling these challenges.
